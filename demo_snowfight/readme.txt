This is a decompiled and patched version of "Robotduck" Benjamin Pratt's Shockwave3D game
"Snowfight" from 2003.

The only purpose of this version is to demonstrate the usage of Steamxtra in a "real" game -
but it's still just a demo and obviously not really on Steam, but instead uses the Steam
app id (480) of the demo game "Spacewar" that comes with the Steamworks SDK.

The original "Snowfight" game can be freely downloaded at https://robotduck.itch.io/snowfight.
